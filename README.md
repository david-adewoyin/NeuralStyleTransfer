# Tensorflow Implementation of Neural Style Transfer  
The architecture is based on the original paper  submitted by Gatys [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).


## Overview
Neural Style transfer is a deep learning  technique used to compose one image in the style of another image.The art style of one image is transferred to another in order to adopt the appearance or visual style of the image. The system uses neural representations to seperate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images.
